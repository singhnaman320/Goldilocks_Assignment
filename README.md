# Goldilocks_Assignment
This repository deals with the codebase of assignment problems related to Goldilocks Tech Solutions Private Ltd.

## Problem-1: This problem is solved in two ways:
               1. Using inbuilt function
               2. Without using inbuilt function

## Problem-2: This problem can also be solved in two ways:
               1. We can use the simple approach of bufferReader.
               2. We can use a build tool like Maven and add the dependency of OpenCSV to read CSV files.

## Problem-3: To solve this problem, we have many approaches:
               1. We can create a Database utility class using Maven and provide a connection to the database. It is the simplest approach. 
               2. We can use Hibernate.
               3. For more advancements we can use Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
               
               Note: As nothing is mentioned about the problem approach, this problem is solved using Hibernate. 

## Problem-4: To solve this problem, Tech stcks used:
               1. Spring Boot
               2. Hibernate
               3. Maven
               4. MySQL
