# Goldilocks_Assignment
This repository deals with the codebase of assignment problems related to Goldilocks Tech Solutions Private Ltd.

## Problem-1: This problem is solved in two ways:
               1. Using inbuilt function
               2. Without using inbuilt function

## Problem-2: This problem can also be solved in two ways:
               1. We can use the simple approach of bufferReader.
               2. We can use a build tool like Maven and add the dependency of OpenCSV to read CSV files.
               
               Note: As nothing is mentioned about the problem approach, this problem is solved using approach-1.

## Problem-3: To solve this problem, we have many approaches:
               1. We can create a Database utility class using Maven and provide a connection to the database. It is the simplest approach. 
               2. We can use Hibernate.
               3. For more advancements we can use Spring Framework and Spring Boot.
               
               Note: As nothing is mentioned about the problem approach, this problem is solved using Hibernate. 

## Problem-4: To solve this problem, Tech stacks used:
               1. Spring Boot
               2. Hibernate
               3. Maven
               4. MySQL

## Problem-5: Implementation is done using a simple searching Algorithm:
               1. Searching in Hashmap with user input using scanner class
               2. Searching in Hashmap by simply taking the array of keys to be searched
               
## Problem-6: This problem is similar to problem-4 and solved using:
               1. Spring Boot
               2. Hibernate
               3. Maven
               4. MySQL     

## Problem-7: To solve this problem:
               1. Write the main class
               2. Compile the problem using [javac CommandLine.java]
               3. To provide an argument and print it in the command line. Use [java CommandLine Hello], Where Hello is the argument
